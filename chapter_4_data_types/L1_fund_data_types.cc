// * ===== fundamental data types ===== *

// A data type is an instruction to the compiler on how to meaningfully
// interpret memory.

// Some newer types in C++, such as std::nullptr_t, have a "_t" suffix. However,
// the naming isn't consistent, and some other types don't have that suffix.

// The types that C++ supports is called "fundamental data types", "primitive
// types", "basic types", or "built-in types".

// It also supports a number of more complex types, called "compound types".

// Note 1: the term "integral type" means a broader class of types that are
// stored in memory like integers, such as bool, the integer types, and the
// various character types like char and wchar_t.
// Note 2: the term "integer" is usually used to refer to the int data type, but
// can also refer to a class of data types that store exclusively integers, like
// float, double, and so on.
