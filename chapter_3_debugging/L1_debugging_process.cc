// * ===== A general approach to debugging ===== *

// The general approach to fixing semantic errors happens in five steps:

// 1. Find the root cause of the problem
// 2. Understand the problem and its inner workings
// 3. Determine a fix to the problem
// 4. Repair the issue
// 5. Lastly, retest the fixed code.

// * ===== Reproducing the error ===== *

// It is extremely important to know how to reproduce the error, because it is
// extremely hard to diagnose an issue if you don't know where or how it occurs.

// * ===== Homing in on the error ===== *

// You can home in on the error, e.g. if the program is not working properly at
// one point, you know fore the sure the error must have happened before that
// points.

// On the other hand, if the program works perfectly well until a point, you
// know that error must have happened after that point.
